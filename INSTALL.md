#### Find your resourcepacks folder

To install this theme you need to first find your resourcepack folder. The quickest and easiest way to do this is from in-game.

1. Open up your desired version of Minecraft.
2. Go into "Options" and then "Resource Packs"
3. Click "Open Pack Folder"

#### Download the pack

If you're familiar with Git, this is the best way as will also keep the pack up to date automatically. Open a terminal or commandline in your resourcepacks folder and clone:

    git clone https://github.com/dracula/minecraft -b v2-x32 "Dracula Theme"

Alternatively, you can download the pack manually by going to any of its release pages:
