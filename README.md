## About

Looking for a dark GUI with vanilla textures, but want something more colorful and stylized than existing ones? This is the pack for you!

**Dracula Theme - Hybrid** is a full makeover of the vanilla GUI using colores from the [Dracula Color Palette](https://draculatheme.com/contribute) with the goal of not only being easy on the eyes, but more interesting to use, too! Featuring custom UI sounds, a unique title screen and even mod support! (wip)
