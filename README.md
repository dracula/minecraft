## Notice

This theme is still undergoing a major overhaul and isn't finished yet. There will be inconsistencies and wip textures, especially if you're using mods.

## Install

#### Find your resourcepacks folder

The quickest and easiest way to do this is from in-game.

 1. Open up your desired version of Minecraft.
 2. Go into "Options" and then "Resource Packs"
 3. Click "Open Pack Folder"
 
The directory that is then opened in your file manager is where resourcepack folders and .zip files will go.

#### Git Download

If you have Git on your system, you can install the pack and get automatic updates by cloning the repo. Open a terminal or commandline in your resourcepacks folder and copy:

    git clone https://github.com/dracula/minecraft -b v2-x16 "Dracula Theme - x16"
    
Note: You can name the pack whatever you want by changing the text in quotation marks at the end!
