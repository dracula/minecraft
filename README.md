## Install

#### Find your resourcepacks folder

1. Open up your desired version of Minecraft.
2. Go into "Options" and then "Resource Packs"
3. Click "Open Pack Folder"

#### Download the pack

The easiest way to do this is to clone the repo, if you have Git installed. Open a terminal or commandline in your resourcepacks folder and clone:
